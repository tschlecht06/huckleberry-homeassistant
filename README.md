# Huckleberry Home Assistant Integration

Home Assistant custom integration for the Huckleberry baby tracking app.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Woyken&repository=huckleberry-homeassistant&category=integration)

## Overview

This integration provides real-time baby tracking in Home Assistant by connecting to Huckleberry's Firebase backend using the [`huckleberry-api`](https://pypi.org/project/huckleberry-api/) Python library.

## Features

- 💤 **Sleep Tracking**: Sensors, switches, and automation services
- 🤱 **Nursing Tracking**: Left/right side tracking with switches and services
- 🍼 **Bottle Feeding**: Log bottle feeds with amount and type
- 🧷 **Diaper Changes**: Log pee, poo, both, or dry checks
- 📏 **Growth Measurements**: Track weight, height, head circumference
- 📅 **Calendar**: Historical events per child in HA's calendar view
- 🔄 **Real-time Sync**: Instant updates via Firebase listeners
- 👶 **Multi-child Support**: Separate devices per child

> **Upgrading from v0.3.x?** See the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md) for a full list of breaking changes (renamed services, entity IDs, and removed device actions).

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS
2. Search for "Huckleberry Baby Tracker"
3. Click Install
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/huckleberry` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Huckleberry"
4. Enter your Huckleberry account email and password
5. Click Submit

## Entities Created

### Per Child:
- **Sensors**:
  - `sensor.{child_name}_sleep` - Sleep status (sleeping, paused, none)
  - `sensor.{child_name}_nursing` - Nursing status (nursing, paused, none)
  - `sensor.{child_name}_profile` - Child profile information
  - `sensor.{child_name}_growth` - Latest growth measurements
  - `sensor.{child_name}_bottle` - Last bottle feeding (time, amount, type)
  - `sensor.{child_name}_bottle_total_today` - Total bottle volume logged today, in mL (`entries` attribute shows the count)
  - `sensor.{child_name}_diaper` - Last diaper change
  - `sensor.{child_name}_feed_reminder` - *(diagnostic, disabled by default)* Raw feeding reminder schedule (`"at"` specific times or `"in"` interval mode) from the Huckleberry app. Attribute values are passed through unmodified — the app's raw units for interval/time values aren't documented, so nothing here is interpreted as minutes/hours yet.

- **Switches** (3):
  - `switch.{child_name}_sleep_timer` - Start/stop the sleep timer
  - `switch.{child_name}_nursing_left` - Left side nursing
  - `switch.{child_name}_nursing_right` - Right side nursing

- **Calendar** (1):
  - `calendar.{child_name}_events` - All historical events (sleep, nursing, diaper, growth)

### Global:
- `sensor.huckleberry_children` - Number of children

## Services

All services support device selection for easy use in automations:

### Sleep Tracking
- `huckleberry.start_sleep`
- `huckleberry.pause_sleep`
- `huckleberry.resume_sleep`
- `huckleberry.cancel_sleep`
- `huckleberry.complete_sleep`

### Nursing Tracking
- `huckleberry.start_nursing`
- `huckleberry.pause_nursing`
- `huckleberry.resume_nursing`
- `huckleberry.switch_nursing_side`
- `huckleberry.cancel_nursing`
- `huckleberry.complete_nursing`

### Bottle Feeding
- `huckleberry.log_bottle` - Log bottle feeding (formula or breastmilk) with amount in oz or ml

### Diaper Changes
- `huckleberry.log_diaper_pee`
- `huckleberry.log_diaper_poo`
- `huckleberry.log_diaper_both`
- `huckleberry.log_diaper_dry`

`log_bottle` and all `log_diaper_*` services accept an optional `start_time` field to backdate an entry (e.g. logging a feed a few minutes after it happened). Omit it and the entry logs as "now", same as before.

### Growth Tracking
- `huckleberry.log_growth`

## Calendar

Each child gets a calendar entity that displays all historical events:

- **💤 Sleep events**: Shows duration and timing of all sleep sessions
- **🍼 Feeding events**: Shows duration, left/right side information
- **🩲 Diaper changes**: Shows type (pee/poo/both/dry) and details
- **📏 Growth measurements**: Shows weight, height, head circumference

The calendar can be added to dashboards and used in automations. Events are automatically fetched when you view the calendar for a specific date range.

### Adding to Dashboard

Add the calendar card to your dashboard:
```yaml
type: calendar
entities:
  - calendar.baby_name_events
```

## Example Automations

See `automation_examples.yaml` for complete examples.

### Bedtime Notification
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Baby Sleep Started"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.baby_name_sleep
        to: "sleeping"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Baby started sleeping"
```

### Feeding Timer Alert
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Nursing Duration Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.baby_name_nursing
        to: "nursing"
        for:
          minutes: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Baby has been nursing for 20 minutes"
```

### Log Bottle Feeding
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Log Bottle at Scheduled Time"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "09:00:00"
    action:
      - service: huckleberry.log_bottle
        target:
          device_id: YOUR_DEVICE_ID  # Select your child's device
        data:
          amount: 120.0
          bottle_type: Formula
          units: ml
```

## Device Actions

Device actions have been removed in v0.4.0. Use HA services instead — they support the same `device_id` selector in the automation editor. See [Services](#services) above and the [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md).
